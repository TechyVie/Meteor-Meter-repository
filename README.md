# Meteor-Meter-repository
This repository contains the files and codes for the Meteor Madness challenge\
Meteor Meter is a simple 2d asteroid simulation that showcases the hazards it might cause upon impact. 
This includes assessing how far can the the meteor impact and the disasters it will create affect not 
only communities, but also our environment.

**How to Access**\
To use Meteor Meter, the user must create a clone repository of the repository.
Afterwards, run it on a platform like VS Code.

**How to Use**\
To use Meteor Meter, you may select at any point on the map or type your desired coordinates.
Then, you may input any number for the meteor's distance and speed.
Lastly, click the 'Simulate Meteor Impact' button and the simulation will begin.

**Features**
- Meteor Meter allows the user to customize the meteor to their liking and even choose a specific location on the map.
- Meteor Meter's zoom feature allows the user to navigate the map of the world.
- On the top left of the program, more details and information about meteors can be found.
  
A lot of features like assessment of local damages, casualties, visualization of the crater and shockwave, and other 
disasters created by the meteor are not in the project due to time constraints and the skill level of the developer (beginner)
